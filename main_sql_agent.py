st.markdown("""
-   **Be Specific:** Mention player names, teams, seasons (e.g., "IPL 2023").
-   **Focus on Facts:** I'm best at answering questions that require data retrieval from the database (e.g., "how many", "who", "what is", "list").
-   **Limit Results:** By default, I'll return the top 10 results. If you need more, ask for "top N rows" (e.g., "top 10 batsmen").
-   **Player Names:** I am trained to resolve common names (e.g., "Virat", "Raina", "Dhoni"), However, it is advisable to use the first and last name of the player if known (e.g., "Dale Steyn", "Yuvraj Singh")
""")

st.subheader("Current Limitations:")
st.markdown("""
-   **Scope of Data:** Currently, I have been equipped with only IPL match data.
-   **Missing Information:** I am not aware of the particular wicket keepers and Captains for individual matches, hence i cannot answer questions surrounding these topics.
-   **Data Freshness:** My knowledge is limited to the data loaded into the database (up to the last ETL run) Currently, until IPL 2025.
-   **Context Limit:** For very complex or long conversations, the underlying AI model has a token limit.
